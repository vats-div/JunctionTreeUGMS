A Junction Tree Framework for Undirected Graphical Model Selection

You can load each file in Matlab using the command load.  For example, to open AraData.mat,

>> load AraData.mat
>> whos

On typing who's, you will see the list of variables.  The variable H is the graph used to compute
the junction tree estimate.  For any questions, contact Divyanshu Vats at vats.div@gmail.com
